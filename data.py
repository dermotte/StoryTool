## Aethel: A World of Neon Decay

Aethel is a *grimly beautiful* cyberpunk setting defined by corporate control, vibrant street culture, and a pervasive sense of desperation. Fifty years after a catastrophic environmental collapse called the “Grey Bloom,” the world struggles under toxic skies and rising sea levels. The gap between the wealthy and the impoverished is immense, fueled by relentless technological advancement and its unintended consequences.

**Power Structure:** The world is nominally ruled by **The Concordance**, a council of seven powerful **Megacorporations** (NovaLife, Zenith Dynamics, Chronos Systems, Aetherium Energy, Vanguard Industries, Kairos Financial, and Seraphim Collective) who control resources and security. However, numerous independent **Shards** – fractured city-states – exist as pockets of resistance, innovation, and lawlessness, like the fortified Veridia, the industrial wasteland of Rustbelt, and the culturally rich Neo-Kyoto.

**The Grey Bloom’s Legacy:** The environmental disaster left the atmosphere toxic, causing widespread food scarcity and acid rain (“Greyfall”).  The Megacorporations control dwindling resources, and **NovaLife** offers expensive and risky genetic modifications to survive the polluted conditions. 

**Life in Aethel:** Transportation is tiered: the wealthy travel the elevated **Sky-Veins** controlled by **Vanguard Industries**, while the desperate navigate the dangerous **Undertow** – a network of tunnels and waterways. Technology is deeply integrated into daily life through **Neural Implants** (called "Wraiths") which connect people to the pervasive virtual reality network, the **Datasphere**. **Zenith Dynamics** provides advanced **Cybernetic Limbs & Organs** and increasingly sentient **Androids** (“Synthetics”), raising ethical concerns about augmentation and artificial intelligence. "Ghost Runners" navigate the Datasphere as skilled hackers. 

Aethel is a world where “progress” has come at a steep cost, and survival often means compromising one’s humanity.

## Anya “Static” Volkov

**Alias:** Static (due to the electrical hum around her workshop)

**Occupation:** Independent Medical Tech & Augmentation Specialist (Freelance)

**Age:** 32

**Appearance:** Wiry with grease-stained hands and intense grey eyes. She favors practical, patched-up clothing and has subtle cybernetic enhancements of her own. A faded scar crosses her left cheek.

**Location:** Operates out of "The Static Clinic"—a dilapidated workshop in the relatively independent city of Veridia.

**Background:** Anya learned tech and basic medical skills scavenging in the Rustbelt before moving to Veridia. She built a reputation for reliable, customized augmentations—often outside legal channels—and became entangled in the city’s underworld. 

**Personality:** Pragmatic, fiercely independent, and cynical, with a dry wit. She’s reserved and distrustful, but loyal to friends. Driven by her work, she often neglects her own well-being.

**Skills:** Expert in cybernetic implantation & repair, basic biotech, tech scavenging, data hacking, first aid, and street smarts.

**Shady Business:** Anya takes questionable jobs to fund her research, working with Ghost Runners, gang leaders, corporate spies, black market organ dealers, and secretly aiding the "Synthetica Collective" – a group fighting for Android rights.

**Motivations:** Anya is obsessed with pushing the boundaries of augmentation research, values her independence, protects her friends, and seeks redemption for past actions.
